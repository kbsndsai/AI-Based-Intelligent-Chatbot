This project centers on the development and deployment of an AI-powered chatbot aimed at enhancing the admissions process by automating responses to prospective student inquiries. The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically through the SBERT model, to provide contextually relevant and accurate answers to admission-related questions. Built using Python and Streamlit for a clean and intuitive user interface, the chatbot is designed to handle a wide array of common admissions queries efficiently, such as program details, deadlines, and application processes, freeing up valuable human resources for more complex tasks. The chatbot also includes a file upload feature that allows administrators to update the dataset as new information becomes available, ensuring that the system remains up-to-date with the latest admissions policies and FAQs.

The Sentence-BERT (SBERT) model used in this project is a specialized version of the original BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, fine-tuned to produce dense vector representations for entire sentences. Unlike BERT, which is primarily designed for token-level predictions, SBERT focuses on generating fixed-size embeddings for sentences, making it ideal for semantic similarity tasks. SBERT uses a combination of siamese and triplet networks to generate sentence embeddings, ensuring that semantically similar sentences are placed closer together in vector space. When a user inputs a query, SBERT encodes it into an embedding, which is compared to pre-encoded embeddings of the questions in the dataset. Using cosine similarity, the model quickly identifies the closest match, allowing the chatbot to provide a highly relevant and contextually accurate response. This process is computationally efficient and highly scalable, even with large datasets.

In terms of architecture, the chatbot uses SBERT to convert user queries into semantic embeddings, which are then matched with pre-encoded questions from the dataset to retrieve the most relevant answer. The project encompasses various aspects of chatbot development, from data gathering and preprocessing to model fine-tuning and deployment. The dataset, comprising historical admissions-related queries and responses, plays a crucial role in training the chatbot, ensuring it can address a wide variety of questions with high accuracy. Additionally, features such as feedback loops and the option to escalate to human support in case of complex queries help improve the chatbot's effectiveness over time. Continuous monitoring and retraining ensure the chatbot stays aligned with the evolving needs of the admissions office.

SBERT is particularly well-suited for this chatbot scenario because of its ability to understand and process the semantics of user queries, rather than relying on keyword matching. In admissions-related queries, phrasing can vary widely even when the underlying question is the same. For instance, a student might ask "What is the deadline for applications?" or "When should I submit my application?" SBERT ensures that both queries are treated as similar by understanding their contextual meaning. This flexibility is crucial for the chatbot to provide consistent and accurate answers, even for paraphrased questions. Additionally, the ability to upload datasets in real-time using Streamlit, combined with the fact that SBERT allows for fast, on-the-fly comparisons, makes this solution ideal for handling dynamic admissions data, ensuring users get the most up-to-date information instantly.

This project not only addresses the common issues found in other admission chatbots, such as the lack of contextual understanding and inefficient data handling, but also improves user engagement by offering timely, relevant, and easy-to-understand answers. The inclusion of advanced NLP techniques enables more natural and meaningful interactions, distinguishing it from basic rule-based systems that rely on predefined answers. Furthermore, this chatbot offers a scalable solution for institutions looking to improve their communication with prospective students while maintaining a seamless and efficient admissions process.
